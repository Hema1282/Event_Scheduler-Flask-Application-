🗓️ Event Scheduler - Flask Web Application
The Event Scheduler is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to create, manage, and track events easily. It provides both a user-friendly web interface and REST API access for event management.
This project is ideal for understanding how to build a real-world Flask application with basic backend logic, form handling, API development, and background tasks.

📦 Project Overview
The Event Scheduler enables users to:
•	Add new events with details like title, description, start time, and end time.
•	View all scheduled events in one place.
•	Edit or delete events when required.
•	Mark events as completed once finished.
•	Filter events based on their status: Upcoming or Completed.
•	Receive console reminders for events that are due within the next 24 hours.
•	Access and interact with the system programmatically through REST API endpoints.
Event details are stored persistently using a simple JSON file, so the data remains intact even after restarting the application.
